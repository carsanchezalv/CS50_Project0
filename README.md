This is my project 0 for Harvard University: CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

In this project I explain the main categories in Formula Racing.
This is formed by 4 html files, which are:

    index.html (main page), formula1.html, formula2.html, formula3.html

In addition, there are two style files (css and scss).
